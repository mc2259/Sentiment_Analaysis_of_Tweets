# Sentiment_Analaysis_of_Tweets
Perform sentiment analysis on Tweets using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
Naive Bayes is a generative model that makes the assumptions that all words are pulled out independently to each other.
This project was implemented in Summer 2020 as part of Xenophobic Meter Project where we were trying to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets of popular political leaders.
